### **Day 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
**Topics:**
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation and Abstraction
- Basic Error Handling (try-catch)

**Project: Library Management System**
- **Description**: Expand on Day 1 by creating an OOP-based library system to manage books, users, and borrow/return actions.
- **Core Features**:
  - Create `Book`, `User`, and `Library` classes.
  - Use constructors to initialize books and users.
  - Implement basic inheritance (e.g., `User` class could be extended to `Student` or `Teacher`).
  - Use encapsulation to protect data (e.g., user ID, book details).
  - Add simple error handling for invalid inputs or operations.
